# Pet Shelter API

Hey there, developer! 👋 Welcome to the **Pet Shelter API**, where we're all about making it easy for you to connect with our furry friends. Whether you're building an app, website, or any other cool project, our API is here to lend a paw. 🐾

### Authentication

If you had authentication to use this API, a few guidelines could be set here, like... Don't have an account yet? [Reach out to us](mailto:pets@shelter), and we'll set you up with the credentials to access our pet-tastic endpoints.

### Example endpoints to look at
This API is entirely made up, but we added a little bit more metadata and examples in the endpoints:

- [`POST /pet`: Add a new pet to the shelter](/docs/#tag/pet-management)
- [`PUT /pet`: Update an existing pet](/docs/#tag/pet-management)
